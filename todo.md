Implement a loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification).
Add backpropagation and a weight update mechanism (gradient descent or similar).
Add data structures to collect and track outputs and losses for each training epoch.
Consider error handling and unit tests for robustness.
